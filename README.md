# January 2023 Recap
- We are excited to announce the deployment of several new features and bug fixes! Our newest game, 99 Balls, has been released, along with City Rider. We have also improved the styling of our platform, as well as fixed various bugs. Additionally, we have resolved an issue with All-Star Math/ELA being down. We hope you enjoy these new updates!
## New Feature
- Weâ€™re excited to announce a brand new game - 99 Balls! This game is designed to test your reflexes and challenge you to get the highest score possible. It's easy to learn, but hard to master. You have to keep an eye on the bouncing balls and tap to shoot them away before they reach the bottom. The more balls you remove, the higher your score. Collect coins along the way to unlock new themes and levels. Put your skills to the test and see how high of a score you can get with 99 Balls!
- We are excited to announce the release of our new game, City Rider! This fun and exciting game allows you to explore the city as you cruise through the streets on your motorcycle. Create a custom rider and customize their look with various clothing and accessories. Compete in races against other riders to earn coins and upgrade your ride with better parts and performance enhancements. You can also explore the city freely, discovering hidden shortcuts and secret areas. With its beautiful graphics and immersive gameplay, City Rider is sure to provide hours of entertainment. So grab your helmet and hit the streets for some high-octane fun!
## Improvements
- We've just released an update with improved styling! We wanted to give our users the best experience possible, so we've made some major changes to the overall look and feel of our product. We've simplified the color palette, increased font sizes, and added additional visual elements that make it easier to navigate. We've also optimized the layout for both desktop and mobile devices, to ensure a seamless experience no matter what device you use. We hope you enjoy the new and improved styling!
## Bug Fix
- We've recently released an update that fixes a few pesky bugs. This includes addressing issues with page loading times and incorrect display of certain images. We've also taken care of a bug that was causing some users to experience difficulty when logging into their accounts. Thanks for your patience while we worked on these improvements - we hope you enjoy the faster, smoother experience!
- We've squashed a pesky bug that was causing All-Star Math and ELA to be down. This should ensure that the platform is always available and running smoothly for our users. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you continue to experience issues, please reach out to our support team.
We hope you enjoy the new games we've added - 99 Balls and City Rider. We've also made some improvements to better styling and fixed bugs in All-Star Math/ELA. We think these updates will make your experience even better! Thanks for playing.
